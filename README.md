# PEARS Staff Report

The [PEARS](https://www.k-state.edu/oeie/pears/) Staff Report summarizes the PEARS activity of [SNAP-Ed](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/snap-ed) staff on a monthly basis. Separate reports are generated for each Illinois SNAP-Ed implementing agency, [Illinois Extension](https://inep.extension.illinois.edu/) and [Chicago Partnership for Health Promotion](https://cphp.uic.edu/).

Samples of input data are provided in the [/sample_inputs](https://github.com/jstadni2/pears_staff_report/tree/main/sample_inputs) directory. Inputs consist of a staff list for the implementating agencies and user and module exports from PEARS. The report outputs are located in the [/sample_output](https://github.com/jstadni2/pears_staff_report/tree/main/sample_output) directory.
